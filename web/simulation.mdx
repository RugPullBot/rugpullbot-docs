# Trading Simulation

RugPullBot creates realistic market simulations using actual historical data from detected rug pulls.

## How Simulation Works

The simulation engine replays historical price data while calculating your position based on:

- Dev wallet initial buy
- Bundler wallet purchases
- Simulated market activity
- Your configured settings

## Simulation Components

### Candlestick Replay

The system replays original candlestick data including:

| Data Point | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| Open | Opening price for the candle |
| High | Highest price reached |
| Low | Lowest price reached |
| Close | Closing price |
| Volume | Trading volume |
| Market Cap | Calculated from price and supply |

### Position Tracking

Your simulated position is calculated as:

```
Position = Dev Buy Amount + (Bundler Wallets × Bundler Amount)
```

This determines your:
- Total holding in tokens
- USD value of holdings
- PnL as price moves

### Bonding Curve Progress

The bonding curve shows how much of the total liquidity has been filled:

- **0%**: No liquidity added
- **100%**: Fully bonded (requires ~85 SOL on Pump.fun)

<Note>
Your dev buy and bundler configuration directly affects bonding curve progress.
</Note>

## Live Statistics

During simulation, you see real-time stats:

| Statistic | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| MCAP | Current simulated market cap |
| PNL | Your profit/loss in USD |
| Multiplier | Return multiple (e.g., "7.1x") |
| Bonding | Bonding curve percentage |
| Holding | Current value of your position |
| Bots | Number of bundler wallets active |
| Holders | Simulated holder count |

## Playback Controls

### Speed Options
- **1x**: Real-time playback
- **2x**: Double speed
- **5x**: Five times speed
- **10x**: Maximum speed

### Play/Pause
Control when the simulation runs. Pausing freezes all statistics.

### Progress
Visual progress bar showing simulation timeline position.

## Market Cap Simulation

Market cap is calculated using:

```
Market Cap = Token Price × Total Supply
```

Where token price is derived from:
- Bonding curve position
- Historical price data
- Simulated trading activity

## Volume Simulation

Trading volume is simulated based on:
- Original rug's volume profile
- Your micro-buy configuration
- Market simulation wallet activity

## Simulation States

| State | Icon | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| Live | 🟢 | Actively running |
| Paused | 🟡 | Temporarily stopped |
| Idle | ⚪ | Not started |
| Rugged | 🔴 | Trigger activated, complete |
