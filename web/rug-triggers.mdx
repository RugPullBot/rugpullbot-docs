**Example**: Set to $50,000 to automatically rug when market cap reaches $50K.

</Card>

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Enable | Toggle holder trigger on/off |
| Amount | Number of holders to trigger (e.g., 100) |

## Trigger Behavior

When a trigger condition is met:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Condition Check">
    System continuously monitors the enabled trigger conditions.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Threshold Reached">
    When condition is met, rug execution begins.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Position Exit">
    All holdings are sold according to withdrawal configuration.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Simulation Complete">
    Coin moves to "Rugged" status with final statistics.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Multiple Triggers

You can enable multiple triggers simultaneously. The rug executes when **any** enabled trigger is reached (OR logic).

**Example Configuration:**
- Market Cap: $50,000 ✅
- Holders: 100 ✅
- Liquidity: Disabled ❌

This rugs when market cap hits $50K **OR** holders reach 100, whichever happens first.

## InstaRUG Trigger

The InstaRUG preset automatically calculates the optimal trigger:

1. Analyzes the original rug's peak market cap
2. Rounds down to nearest significant figure
3. Sets market cap trigger to this value

<Note>
InstaRUG disables holder and liquidity triggers, using only market cap.
</Note>

## Trigger Recommendations

| Goal | Recommended Trigger |
|------|---------------------|
| Maximum Profit | Market cap at original peak |
| Quick Exit | Lower holder count (50-100) |
| Natural Timing | Combine market cap + holder |
| Liquidity Focus | Liquidity-based trigger |

## Manual Rug Option

If you don't want automatic triggers, disable all triggers and use the manual "Sell All" button in the coin view.

<Warning>
Manual rugging requires you to actively monitor the simulation.
</Warning>

## Trigger Analytics

After simulation completes, view trigger analytics in the Rugged Coins section:
