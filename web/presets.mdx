# Presets

Presets are pre-configured strategy templates that automatically set up your coin with optimized parameters.

## Available Presets

### InstaRUG

  Rugs at the exact market cap right before the original rug happened.
</Card>

The InstaRUG preset is designed for maximum accuracy by:

1. **Analyzing Original Rug Data**: Reads the original dev wallet and bundler configuration
2. **Calculating Optimal Settings**: Sets dev buy and bundler amounts based on actual data
3. **Setting Trigger Point**: Automatically sets market cap trigger to the peak before the original rug

#### InstaRUG Configuration

When you apply InstaRUG, it automatically sets:

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Bundler Mode | Instant |
| Dev Buy Amount | Calculated from original dev |
| Bundler Wallets | Count from original bundlers |
| Bundler Amount | Randomized by AI |
| Honeypot | Enabled |
| Market Cap Trigger | Original peak market cap |
| Holder Trigger | Disabled |
| Liquidity Trigger | Disabled |

<Tip>
InstaRUG requires AI analysis of the original rug data. Make sure your coin was created using "Let AI Handle It" for best results.

## Preset Requirements

### InstaRUG Requirements

For InstaRUG to work correctly:

1. **Source Rug Data**: Coin must have `sourceRugId` (created via "Let AI Handle It")
2. **Rug Analysis Complete**: System must have analyzed the original rug
3. **Withdrawal Address**: At least one withdrawal address must be configured

<Warning>
If no withdrawal address is set, InstaRUG will attempt to use your first dashboard wallet. If none exist, you'll be prompted to add one.
</Warning>

## Custom Presets

While the system comes with built-in presets, your saved settings effectively become custom presets when you:

1. Configure a coin with your preferred settings
2. Save the settings
3. Use as reference for future coins

<Note>
A formal custom preset saving feature is planned for future updates.
