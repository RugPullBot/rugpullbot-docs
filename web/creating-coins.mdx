# Creating Coins

The Create Coin page allows you to set up new token simulations based on real historical rug pull data.

## Overview

Creating a coin in RugPullBot means setting up a simulation that replays actual market data from a historical rug pull. This gives you realistic price action and trading patterns to analyze.

## Token Information

### Required Fields

| Field | Description | Requirements |
|-------|-------------|--------------|
| **Name** | Token display name | Required |
| **Ticker** | Token symbol | 2-12 characters, auto-uppercased |

### Optional Fields

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Description** | Token description text |
| **Twitter** | Twitter/X profile URL |
| **Telegram** | Telegram group URL |
| **Website** | Project website URL |
| **Token Image** | PNG, JPEG, or GIF upload |

## Let AI Handle It

<Tip>
The "Let AI Handle It" button automatically fills in token metadata from the latest detected rug in the queue.
</Tip>

When clicked, this feature:
1. Fetches the most recent "ready" rug from the queue
2. Auto-fills name, ticker, description, and social links
3. Uses the original token's image
4. Sets the mint address for accurate simulation

This is the fastest way to create a realistic simulation using verified rug data.

## Token Preview

As you fill in the form, the preview card updates in real-time showing:
- Token image (or generated avatar from ticker)
- Name and ticker
- Description preview
- Social link buttons

## Launch Details

The Launch Details panel shows simulation parameters:

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Network | Solana |
| Platform | Pump.fun |
| Initial Supply | 1,000,000,000 |
| Projected CA | Contract address (from original rug or generated) |
| Launch Fee | 0.02 SOL |

## System Status

The header bar shows real-time system status:

- **SOL WebSocket**: Connection latency
- **SOL Node**: Current block number
- **RPC Nodes**: Number of online nodes
- **Active Users**: Current platform users
