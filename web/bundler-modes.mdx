# Bundler Modes

Bundler modes determine how your bundler wallets execute purchases during simulation launch.

## Available Modes

### Safe Mode

<Card title="Safe" icon="shield-check">
  Conservative execution with built-in protections.
</Card>

**Characteristics:**
- Slower execution speed
- Maximum protection against detection
- Recommended for beginners

### Instant Mode

<Card title="Instant" icon="bolt">
  Fastest possible execution for all bundler wallets.
</Card>

**Characteristics:**
- All wallets execute simultaneously
- Highest bonding curve impact
- Used by InstaRUG preset

### Delayed Mode

<Card title="Delayed" icon="clock">
  Staggered execution over time for natural appearance.
</Card>

**Characteristics:**
- Wallets execute over several minutes
- Appears more organic
- Used by "LOOOONG Game" preset

## Configuration Options

### Sniper Selection

Select up to 4 snipers from available options:
- Sniper Alpha
- Sniper Beta
- Sniper Gamma
- Sniper Delta

<Note>
Snipers simulate early buyers that purchase immediately after launch.
</Note>

### ASAP Mode

When enabled, executes all purchases as fast as possible regardless of bundler mode.

### Triggered Execution

Wait for a specific condition before executing bundler purchases.

## Mode Comparison

| Feature | Safe | Instant | Delayed |
|---------|------|---------|---------|
| Execution Speed | Slow | Immediate | Gradual |
| Detection Risk | Lowest | Higher | Medium |
| Bonding Impact | Spread | Maximum | Spread |
| Natural Appearance | Medium | Low | High |

## Choosing a Mode

### Use Safe Mode When:
- You're new to the platform
- Testing configurations
- Prioritizing protection over speed

### Use Instant Mode When:
- Maximum bonding curve impact needed
- Using InstaRUG preset
- Speed is critical

### Use Delayed Mode When:
- Long-term simulation planned
- Natural trading pattern desired
- Using LOOOONG Game preset

## Bundler Wallet Configuration

Regardless of mode, configure these parameters:

| Parameter | Description | Range |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| Bundler Wallets | Number of wallets | 1-100 |
| Bundler Amount | SOL per wallet | 0.01-10 SOL |
| Random Amount | Randomize per wallet | On/Off |

### Random Amount

When enabled, bundler amounts are randomized within a range for more natural appearance.

<Tip>
The InstaRUG preset enables random bundler amounts by default based on AI analysis of the original rug.
</Tip>

## Impact on Simulation

Your bundler configuration affects:

1. **Initial Position Size**: Total tokens acquired at launch
2. **Bonding Curve**: Percentage filled immediately
3. **Market Cap Impact**: Initial market cap boost
4. **Detection Profile**: How natural the launch appears
