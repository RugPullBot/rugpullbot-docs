Split withdrawals across multiple wallets:

## Withdrawal Errors

### No Address Configured
If no withdrawal address is set when applying InstaRUG:
- System prompts you to add an address
- Or auto-selects your first dashboard wallet

### Invalid Address
- Check address format (base58, 44 characters)
- Ensure address is a valid Solana wallet

### Insufficient Balance
- Ensure enough SOL for gas fees
- Check bonding curve position
