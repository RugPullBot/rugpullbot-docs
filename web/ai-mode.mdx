# AI Mode

<Warning>
**AI Mode is the pinnacle of the RugPullBot system** - a fully automated solution that handles everything from token creation to trading execution without manual intervention.
</Warning>

## Overview

AI Mode represents the most advanced tier of RugPullBot's capabilities. Unlike manual simulations, AI Mode is a completely autonomous system that creates, launches, and manages rug pull simulations from start to finish using artificial intelligence.

## Requirements

### Wallet Balance

<Card title="Minimum Balance Required" icon="wallet">
  **40-300 SOL** in total wallet balance (across all wallets)
</Card>

AI Mode requires substantial capital to operate effectively because it:
- Handles high-volume trading operations
- Manages multiple bundler wallets simultaneously
- Executes complex market manipulation strategies
- Maintains liquidity across multiple positions

<Note>
If you have less than 40 SOL, contact the developer on Telegram to request a custom lower limit. However, performance may be limited with lower capital.
</Note>

### Plan Eligibility

AI Mode is available on the following plans:
- ✅ **Basic** (2.5 SOL)
- ✅ **Advanced** (4.5 SOL)
- ✅ **Advanced Boosted**
- ✅ **Premium** (6.5 SOL)
- ✅ **Any Boosted Plan**
- ❌ **Tester** (not available)

## What AI Mode Does

AI Mode handles the entire lifecycle of a rug pull simulation automatically:

### 1. Token Discovery & Cloning

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Finds Successful Coins">
    The AI continuously monitors the market for the most recent and successful coins, analyzing:
    - Trading volume patterns
    - Price movement velocity
    - Holder growth rate
    - Social engagement metrics
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Clones Top Performers">
    Once a successful coin is identified, AI Mode automatically:
    - Copies the token name, ticker, and description
    - Replicates social media presence (Twitter, Telegram)
    - Mirrors the token's branding and imagery
    - Analyzes the original's trading patterns
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### 2. Automated Infrastructure Setup

The AI creates all necessary infrastructure without manual setup:

| Component | What It Creates |
|-----------|-----------------|
| **Telegram** | Community chat group with automated moderation |
| **Discord** | Server with channels and bot integrations |
| **Website** | Professional landing page with token information |
| **Servers** | Backend infrastructure for trading operations |

### 3. Intelligent Trading Execution

AI Mode makes real-time trading decisions based on market conditions:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Buy Decisions" icon="arrow-trend-up">
    Automatically determines optimal entry points based on:
    - Market momentum
    - Liquidity depth
    - Holder distribution
    - Price volatility
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Sell Decisions" icon="arrow-trend-down">
    Executes exits strategically:
    - Gradual position reduction
    - Peak detection algorithms
    - Profit-taking schedules
    - Stop-loss automation
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### 4. Anti-Sniper & Honeypot Control

AI Mode includes sophisticated protection mechanisms:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Blacklist Control">
    **When to Block Selling:**
    - During accumulation phase
    - When maintaining price floors
    - To prevent early dumping
    - During critical price levels
    
    The AI automatically enables honeypot mode to prevent regular users from selling.
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Sniper Management">
    **Strategic Sniper Handling:**
    1. Allow snipers to sell initially
    2. Let them buy more at lower prices
    3. Block them once position is optimal
    4. Maximize capital extraction
    
    This creates a trap for sophisticated traders.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Market Analysis">
    AI scans for trending coins and identifies profitable patterns
  </Step>
  <Step title="Token Creation">
    Automatically clones successful tokens with optimized metadata
  </Step>
  <Step title="Infrastructure Deployment">
    Sets up Telegram, Discord, website, and trading infrastructure
  </Step>
  <Step title="Launch Execution">
    Initiates bundler purchases and establishes market presence
  </Step>
  <Step title="Trading Management">
    Continuously monitors and executes buy/sell decisions
  </Step>
  <Step title="Protection Activation">
    Dynamically enables honeypot and blacklist controls
  </Step>
  <Step title="Profit Extraction">
    Executes optimal exit strategy and routes profits to configured wallets
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Performance Optimization

### Capital Requirements by Volume

| Capital Range | Expected Performance |
|---------------|---------------------|
| 40-100 SOL | Basic operations, moderate volume |
| 100-200 SOL | High-volume trading, multiple positions |
| 200-300 SOL | Maximum efficiency, institutional-level operations |
| 300+ SOL | Unlimited potential, market-moving capacity |

### Why High Capital Matters

AI Mode requires substantial capital because:

1. **Bundler Wallet Distribution**: 20+ wallets need funding for coordinated purchases
2. **Liquidity Provision**: Maintaining buy walls and price floors
3. **Volume Generation**: Creating natural-looking trading activity
4. **Slippage Management**: Executing large orders without price impact
5. **Reserve Capital**: Handling unexpected market movements

## Enabling AI Mode

<Steps>
  <Step title="Verify Plan">
    Ensure you have Basic, Advanced, Premium, or any Boosted plan
  </Step>
  <Step title="Fund Wallets">
    Deposit at least 40 SOL across your wallet(s)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Activate AI Mode">
    Navigate to Settings → AI Mode → Enable
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Preferences">
    Set risk tolerance, target profit margins, and withdrawal addresses
  </Step>
  <Step title="Launch">
    AI Mode will begin operating autonomously
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Monitoring AI Mode

While AI Mode operates autonomously, you can monitor its performance:

- **Real-time Dashboard**: Track active positions and PnL
- **Trade History**: Review all executed buy/sell decisions
- **Performance Metrics**: Analyze win rate and average returns
- **System Logs**: View AI decision-making process

## Safety & Controls

<Warning>
AI Mode operates with high autonomy. Ensure you understand the risks before enabling.
</Warning>

### Manual Override

You can pause or stop AI Mode at any time:
- **Pause**: Halts new position entries, maintains existing positions
- **Stop**: Closes all positions and exits AI Mode

### Risk Management

Built-in safety features:
- Maximum position size limits
- Automatic stop-loss triggers
- Capital preservation rules
- Exposure diversification
