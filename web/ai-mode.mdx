# AI Mode

<Warning>
**AI Mode is the pinnacle of the RugPullBot system** - a fully automated solution that handles everything from token creation to trading execution without manual intervention.
</Warning>

## Overview

AI Mode represents the most advanced tier of RugPullBot's capabilities. Unlike manual simulations, AI Mode is a completely autonomous system that creates, launches, and manages rug pull simulations from start to finish using artificial intelligence.

**Key Highlights:**
- ⚡ **15-20 minute average cycle** - From creation to rug execution
- 🤖 **Fully automated** - Zero manual intervention required
- 💼 **Auto-generates wallets** - Creates bundler and withdrawal wallets automatically
- 🧠 **Intelligent rug timing** - AI decides when to sell based on performance, snipers, and market conditions
- 💰 **Automatic profit extraction** - Withdraws to generated wallet address after rug

<Tip>
Once you enable AI Mode, you can literally walk away. The AI will handle token creation, infrastructure setup, trading, rug execution, and profit withdrawal all on its own.
</Tip>

## Requirements

### Wallet Balance

<Card title="Minimum Balance Required" icon="wallet">

## What AI Mode Does

AI Mode handles the entire lifecycle of a rug pull simulation automatically:

### 1. Token Discovery & Cloning

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Finds Successful Coins">
    The AI continuously monitors the market for the most recent and successful coins, analyzing:
    - Trading volume patterns
    - Price movement velocity
    - Holder growth rate
    - Social engagement metrics
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Clones Top Performers">
    Once a successful coin is identified, AI Mode automatically:
    - Copies the token name, ticker, and description
    - Replicates social media presence (Twitter, Telegram)
    - Mirrors the token's branding and imagery
    - Analyzes the original's trading patterns
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### 2. Automated Infrastructure Setup

The AI creates all necessary infrastructure without manual setup:

| Component | What It Creates |
|-----------|-----------------|
| **Telegram** | Community chat group with automated moderation |
| **Discord** | Server with channels and bot integrations |
| **Website** | Professional landing page with token information |
| **Servers** | Backend infrastructure for trading operations |
| **Bundler Wallets** | Automatically generated wallets for coordinated trading |
| **Withdrawal Wallet** | Dedicated withdrawal address for profit extraction |

<Note>
**Zero Manual Setup Required**: AI Mode generates its own bundler wallets and withdrawal addresses automatically. You don't need to create or configure any wallets manually.
</Note>

### 3. Intelligent Trading Execution

AI Mode makes real-time trading decisions based on market conditions:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Buy Decisions" icon="arrow-trend-up">
    Automatically determines optimal entry points based on:
    - Market momentum
    - Liquidity depth
    - Holder distribution
    - Price volatility
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Rug/Exit Decisions" icon="skull">
    **AI decides when to rug the coin** based on:
    - Coin performance trajectory
    - Sniper activity and behavior
    - Current SOL price and market conditions
    - Profit margin targets
    - Risk assessment algorithms
    
    The AI autonomously determines the optimal moment to execute the rug and exit all positions.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Typical Lifecycle

<Card title="15-20 Minute Average" icon="clock">
  **Default AI Mode Cycle Time**
  
  Most AI Mode coins operate for 15-20 minutes from launch to rug by default. The entire process is fully automated:
  
  1. **0-2 min**: Token creation and infrastructure setup
  2. **2-5 min**: Initial bundler purchases and liquidity establishment
  3. **5-15 min**: Active trading, volume generation, and holder accumulation
  4. **15-20 min**: AI analyzes performance and executes rug when conditions are optimal
  5. **Post-rug**: Automatic profit withdrawal to generated wallet address
</Card>

<Warning>
The AI continuously monitors multiple factors and may rug earlier or hold longer depending on performance. The 15-20 minute window is an average, not a fixed duration.
</Warning>

### 4. Rug Decision Intelligence

The AI continuously analyzes multiple factors to determine the optimal rug timing:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Performance Analysis">
    **Real-time Coin Performance Metrics:**
    - Current profit margin vs. expected potential
    - Market cap trajectory (rising, plateauing, or declining)
    - Trading volume sustainability
    - Holder growth rate and distribution
    
    If performance isn't meeting targets, AI may rug early. If performance exceeds expectations, it may hold longer.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Sniper Detection & Response">
    **Sniper Activity Monitoring:**
    - Number and sophistication of detected snipers
    - Sniper profit extraction patterns
    - Risk of being counter-rugged by smart snipers
    - Optimal timing to trap or avoid snipers
    
    Heavy sniper presence may trigger earlier rug execution to minimize losses.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Market Conditions">
    **External Factors:**
    - Current SOL price and volatility
    - Overall Solana network congestion
    - Pump.fun platform activity levels
    - Competing rug activity in the market
    
    Favorable market conditions may extend the cycle; poor conditions trigger faster exits.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Card title="Decision Algorithm" icon="brain">
  The AI weighs all factors in real-time and calculates an "optimal rug score." When the score indicates peak profitability or elevated risk, the rug is executed automatically.
  
  **You don't need to monitor or make decisions** - the AI handles everything.
</Card>

### 5. Anti-Sniper & Honeypot Control

AI Mode includes sophisticated protection mechanisms:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Blacklist Control">
    **When to Block Selling:**
    - During accumulation phase
    - When maintaining price floors
    - To prevent early dumping
    - During critical price levels
    
    The AI automatically enables honeypot mode to prevent regular users from selling.
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Sniper Management">
    **Strategic Sniper Handling:**
    1. Allow snipers to sell initially
    2. Let them buy more at lower prices
    3. Block them once position is optimal
    4. Maximize capital extraction
    
    This creates a trap for sophisticated traders.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Performance Optimization

### Capital Requirements by Volume

| Capital Range | Expected Performance |
|---------------|---------------------|
| 40-100 SOL | Basic operations, moderate volume |
| 100-200 SOL | High-volume trading, multiple positions |
| 200-300 SOL | Maximum efficiency, institutional-level operations |
| 300+ SOL | Unlimited potential, market-moving capacity |

### Why High Capital Matters

AI Mode requires substantial capital because:

1. **Bundler Wallet Distribution**: 20+ wallets need funding for coordinated purchases
2. **Liquidity Provision**: Maintaining buy walls and price floors
3. **Volume Generation**: Creating natural-looking trading activity
4. **Slippage Management**: Executing large orders without price impact
5. **Reserve Capital**: Handling unexpected market movements

## Automatic Wallet Creation

<Card title="Zero Manual Setup" icon="wand-magic-sparkles">
  **AI Mode generates all required wallets automatically:**
  
  ### Bundler Wallets
  - Created fresh for each coin simulation
  - Funded and distributed automatically
  - No need to manage multiple wallet addresses
  - AI handles coordination between all bundler wallets
  
  ### Withdrawal Wallet
  - Generated automatically for profit extraction
  - Unique address for each AI Mode session
  - Profits are sent here after successful rug
  - You don't need to configure withdrawal addresses manually
</Card>

<Warning>
**Important**: While AI Mode creates its own wallets, you still need to maintain the minimum 40 SOL balance in your main account wallets to fund operations. The AI draws capital from your main wallets to fund the bundler wallets it creates.
</Warning>
