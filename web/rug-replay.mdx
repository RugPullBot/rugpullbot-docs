# Rug Replay System

The Rug Replay System is the core technology behind RugPullBot's realistic simulations. It captures real rug pull events and allows you to replay them with custom parameters.

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Detection">
    Our system continuously monitors Solana for potential rug pull events on Pump.fun and other platforms.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Data Collection">
    When a rug is detected, we capture complete candlestick data, trader information, and market statistics.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Queue Processing">
    Detected rugs are processed and their historical data is prepared for simulation replay.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Simulation">
    When you launch a coin, the system replays the original price action using the captured data.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Data Captured

For each detected rug, the system captures:

| Data Type | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Candlesticks | OHLCV data at 1-minute intervals |
| Market Cap | Historical market cap progression |
| Bonding Curve | Curve progress over time |
| Holders | Holder count changes |
| Top Traders | Wallet addresses and profit data |
| Dev Wallet | Original developer's trading activity |

## Coin View Page

When viewing an active simulation, you see:

### TradingView Chart
- Real-time candlestick chart
- Price progression matching original rug
- Volume indicators
- Customizable timeframes

### Live Statistics
- **Market Cap**: Current simulated market cap
- **PnL**: Your profit/loss with multiplier
- **Bonding Curve**: Progress percentage
- **Holding**: Current position value
- **Bots**: Number of bundler wallets
- **Holders**: Simulated holder count

### Playback Controls
- **Play/Pause**: Control simulation speed
- **Speed Multiplier**: 1x, 2x, 5x, 10x playback
- **Progress Bar**: Visual timeline of simulation

## Simulation States

| State | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Pending** | Coin created, not yet launched |
| **Live** | Simulation actively running |
| **Paused** | Simulation paused by user |
| **Rugged** | Rug trigger activated, simulation complete |

## Quick Actions

From the coin view, you can:

- **Volume**: Generate additional trading volume
- **Sell 25%**: Sell a quarter of holdings
- **Sell 50%**: Sell half of holdings
- **Sell All**: Exit entire position
